# Welcome to my Software Engineering Class!
## What will you see here?
All of my programming homework assignments will be here. I will ***not*** include any required reading material, or any other supplimental here. All of the explanations for each programming assignment will be attached to what I submit on Canvas.

## How is this organized
This is the main branch, and for simplicity sake only the .readme file will be here. Each homework assignment will be in numerical order in their respective folders.
